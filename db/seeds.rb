# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Post.delete_all

# Post.create(
#   title: "The Very First Post",
#   published_date: Time.now - 1.day,
#   body:
#   Do you want to build a snowman?
#   }
# )
#
# Post.create(
#   title: "My Second Post",
#   published_date: Time.now,
#   body:
#   %Q{It doesn't have to be a snowman}
